So, \"A\" becomes \"D\", \"B\" becomes \"E\", and so on.  \n\n Your message:  HI FRIEND\n Secret message:  KL  IRHQG\n\nWhen your friend gets the message, they use the same code (shifting back three letters) to decode it.\n\nThat's basically what cryptography does - it uses math to scramble messages so only people with the \"key\" (like your shifting code) can unscramble and read them.  Computers use much more complicated codes, but the idea is the same: keeping messages secret and safe! \n"
